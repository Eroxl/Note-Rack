## Note
Please note this is still a WIP and probably wont be usable for a while. Especially some of the more advanced features.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple but robust markdown editor that is able to be used by students to simplify school work.

## Planned Features
Currently the planned features / features we hope to include in the final build are as follows

- [ ] Ability To Scan Documents Into Markdown Format Using OCR And A Classifying Network
  - Allow users to easily scan documents handed out in class into the markdown format and be easily accessed in the note rack. For instance scanning an English worksheet into the note rack to be filled out online.

- [x] Markdown Editor
  - A robust and stylish markdown editor that supports the basic markdown standard as well as some more advanced custom markdown features specifically designed to be used with school work.

- [x] Notion Like Markdown Keybinds
  - Allow users to easily add markdown elements to a document by typing in the markdown key (ex. ### becoming h3 or [ ] becoming a checklist)

- [ ] PDF / DOCX Exporting
  - Allow users to export the file to a .pdf or .docx file to more easily be able to hand in or print out assignments
